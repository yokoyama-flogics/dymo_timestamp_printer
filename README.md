## File Descriptions

### [Directory `rpi/`](./rpi)

Raspberry Pi software written in shell script is located in the `bin/` directory.

- `printdatetime_server`: A label printing server that runs continuously.

- `printdatetime`: A test program for printing timestamp labels.  (Typically not needed.)

- `start_printdatetime_server`: A monitoring program that should be periodically run via cron or similar.

- `gen_datetime_label`: A sub-program that generates the label image, called by `printdatetime_server`.

- `lpr_datetime_label`: A sub-program that prints the label image, also called by `printdatetime_server`.

### [Directory `etc/`](./etc)

Miscellaneous files that may be helpful.  (Details have been forgotten.)

### [Directory `examples/`](./examples)

Example files for reference.

## Notes

- The Dymo Linux driver can be downloaded [here](https://www.dymo-label-printers.co.uk/news/download-dymo-sdk-for-linux.html).

- [This tutorial](http://www.penguintutor.com/linux/printing-cups) is very useful for setting up a Dymo printer with Raspberry Pi.

- You need to obtain the font file legally.

- Some additional software (e.g. ImageMagick) may be required.

- You can connect a button to start printing.  The GPIO number for the switch is defined by `PORT` in `printdatetime_server`.  Please refer to tutorials like [this one](https://www.circuitbasics.com/how-to-set-up-buttons-and-switches-on-the-raspberry-pi/).

- A more advanced library for GPIO monitoring can also be used.

- Feel free to fork this Git repository if you'd like. :)
